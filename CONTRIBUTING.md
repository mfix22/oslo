# Contributing

To add a new open source license, fork this repo and add a new file in `/assets/documents` with the name `[YOUR_LICENSE_NAME]_LICENSE.md`, and submit a new pull request.

To allow your license file to have string interpolation, please use the mustache format, i.e. if you want the word `name` to be replaced everywhere with say, the authors name, use `{{ name }}` and the author's name will be interpolated.
